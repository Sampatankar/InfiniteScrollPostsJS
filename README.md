# InfiniteScrollPostsJS
11/20: Fetch, Async/Await &amp; CSS Loader - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app will display blog posts from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and add an infinite scroll to fetch posts and also add a filter box.

The project will create a UI and custom CSS loader animation, fetch initial posts from the API and display them.  The app will also scroll down, show the loader and fetch the next set of posts.  These fetched posts will be subject to the filter.

This is the 11th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
